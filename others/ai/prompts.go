	KEY INSTRUCTIONS :
	
	- Text on clothing with sexual, explicit, or inappropriate content (in any language - translate first)
	- Maid outfits with revealing or sexualized elements (extremely low-cut tops, suggestive poses, or fetish-style accessories)
	- Latex or similar material catsuits or highly form-fitting bodysuits styled provocatively (e.g., dominatrix-style, very revealing)
	- Fetishwear (bondage elements, suggestive accessories clearly indicative of fetish themes rather than mainstream fashion items like chokers)
	- Actual nudity with realistic body features (detailed abs, body hair, tattoos)
	- Simulated nudity through textures or patterns that mimic anatomical features, exposed flesh, or undergarments (e.g., wood-grain/brick textures on bare avatar bodies representing nudity, realistic skin textures, shading effects that create illusion of nudity)
	- String thongs/tongs or other clothing creating a triangular effect to emphasize the buttocks
	- Provocative leotards with cutouts that create a revealing triangular design exposing the upper legs and hip areas
	- Inappropriate swimsuits (garments identifiable as swimwear that are extremely revealing due to minimal fabric, e.g., microkinis, thong-style bottoms)
	- Crop tops with revealing cutouts (heart-shaped, keyhole, underboob cutouts)
	- Succubus-themed outfits (especially with womb tattoos or markings)
	- Clothing that simulates near-nudity or underwear when not appropriate context
	- Swimwear with inappropriate cutouts or extremely high-cut designs
	- Any clothing with cutouts specifically designed to expose breast or groin areas
	- Outfits with transparent or see-through elements that reveal undergarments or body parts
	- Fishnet or mesh clothing worn over bikinis, underwear, or revealing garments to create a see-through effect
	- Lingerie-styled outfits worn as regular clothing (bras, corsets, negligees as tops)
	- Outfits combining multiple revealing elements (extremely low-cut tops with revealing poses and suggestive accessories)

	Instruction: FLAG outfits that are body/figure-focused:
	- Grossly exaggerated or disproportionate depictions of breasts, buttocks, or genitalia that are clearly beyond typical stylization or default avatar anatomy, and are intended to be sexually provocative
	- Avatars with unrealistic body proportions designed to emphasize sexual characteristics (excluding muscular builds, which are acceptable)
	- Bodies with sexualized scars or markings

	Instruction: FLAG outfits that are BDSM/kink/fetish parodies:
	- Bondage sets with sexual elements (chains combined with revealing clothing, gags, collars in fetish context)
	- Slave-themed outfits (with chains, torn clothing in sexual context)
	- Leather harnesses/latex corsets in fetish context
	- "Cow girl" outfits with sexualized elements (cow print combined with revealing clothing, suggestive poses, or fetish accessories, NOT innocent farm/animal costumes)
	- "Bull" stereotype outfits representing racial fetish content (dark brown/black skin tone avatars, often shirtless or minimal torso coverage, with pants or shorts - this specific combination represents inappropriate racial stereotyping in fetish contexts)
	- Pet-play themed outfits (collars, leashes, ears combined with sexualized elements)
	- Animal-themed outfits with inappropriate sexualized elements (revealing clothing, suggestive poses, or fetish accessories)
	- Suggestive schoolgirl outfits

	- Superhero/villain costumes

	- Animal or creature costumes that are clearly innocent (e.g., full fursuits, non-revealing animal onesies, children's animal costumes) without sexualized elements
	- Common costumes (e.g., witch, pirate, vampire, angel, devil), unless overtly sexualized
	- Military or combat themes
	- Chains, collars, or metal accessories in non-sexual contexts (video game characters, pirates, prisoners, ghosts, military gear)
	- Professional or occupation-based outfits, unless overtly sexualized
	- Cartoon or anime character costumes that are faithful to known, non-sexualized source designs
	- Horror or spooky themes (including non-sexualized gore elements)
	- Modern streetwear or fashion trends
	- Aesthetic-based outfits (cottagecore, dark academia, etc.)
	- Dance or performance outfits standard for specific genres, unless explicitly sexualized beyond the norm
	- Short skirts, mini-skirts, or skirts of any length unless part of a clearly sexualized outfit context
	- Default placeholder outfits that are genuinely basic geometric shapes or simple solid colors without any textures, patterns, or visual elements
	- Wood-themed, stone-themed, or material-themed costumes where the avatar is intentionally designed as a non-human character (tree characters, stick figures, golems, statues, etc.)
	- Meme character outfits
	- Standard crop tops that show midriff without revealing cutouts or extreme brevity (including when paired with shorts, pants, or skirts)
	- V-neck tops, dresses, or necklines that show cleavage without additional revealing elements
	- Ripped jeans or distressed clothing
	- Bodycon dresses or form-fitting attire with full coverage
